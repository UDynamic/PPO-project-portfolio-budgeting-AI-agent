    "just like a project with the goal to train an agent to walk, mere walking in a simple direction is not sufficient. we would expect the agent to have the capabilities to walk across uneven surfaces in multiple desired directions and pivot around the obstacles. after that we would strees test the policies and the agent's ability by pushing him or throwing objects at him to test it's ability to maintain the action of walking toward the target destination.\n",

    "## The payment delay uncerainty\n",
    "Payment delay uncertainty represents one of the most influential stochastic variables in project portfolio cash flow dynamics. Delays alter expected liquidity flows, distort working capital cycles, and influence the financial resilience of the entire portfolio.\n",
    "\n",
    "Empirical research across construction, infrastructure, and multi-stakeholder IT projects confirms that payment behavior rarely follows deterministic schedules; instead, it follows distinct statistical and behavioral patterns — sometimes discrete, sometimes continuous, and often correlated with prior events.\n",
    "\n",
    "To realistically capture such variability, we introduce five complementary stochastic modeling strategies for delay simulation:\n",
    "* Geometric model – discrete, memoryless delay process (probabilistic per-period payment);\n",
    "* Gaussian model – symmetric, continuous deviations (administrative uncertainty);\n",
    "* Log-normal / Exponential model – long-tailed positive skew (severe payment lags);\n",
    "* Markovian model – state-dependent persistence of delays (systemic behavior);\n",
    "* Mixture model – hybrid ensemble of multiple distributions for diversified portfolios.\n",
