    "just like a project with the goal to train an agent to walk, mere walking in a simple direction is not sufficient. we would expect the agent to have the capabilities to walk across uneven surfaces in multiple desired directions and pivot around the obstacles. after that we would strees test the policies and the agent's ability by pushing him or throwing objects at him to test it's ability to maintain the action of walking toward the target destination.\n",

Our choice balances experimental clarity and realism: the latent-factor + shock tests capture first-order correlated behaviors relevant to portfolio budgeting while keeping the study focused."
