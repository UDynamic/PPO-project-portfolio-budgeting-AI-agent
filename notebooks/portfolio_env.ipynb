    "Milestone-based payment models in this study explicitly include the common hybrid ‘advance + milestone + retention’ structure. We model the advance as the first milestone (t=0) with advance fraction α_adv (default 15%). Subsequent milestone fractions are sampled from a Dirichlet distribution and scaled to satisfy Σ payments + retention = BAC. Payments are subject to geometric delays and multiplicative noise. This parametric approach allows the environment to represent advance-funded, milestone-funded, and hybrid contracts with a single, transparent generator; sensitivity analyses over α_adv and retention r are presented to demonstrate robustness.\n",

    "Primary experiments assume independent payment timing and amount uncertainty across projects to focus on budget allocation behavior. To test robustness, we include a single correlated stress scenario: with probability $p_{global}$ (0.01 per episode) a global shock simultaneously increases expected payment delays and reduces received payment amounts for all projects for $s$ timesteps. \n",

    "We intentionally prioritize clarity and the core budgeting problem. Full correlation modeling is orthogonal to the main contribution and would significantly enlarge the scope.

The latent-factor Z_t perturbs per-project payment parameters (amount/delay) with small loadings; this introduces controllable pairwise correlation without over-parameterizing the environment. Additionally, infrequent global shocks (probability $𝑝_{global​}$) synchronously increase delays and reduce payment amounts to simulate systemic stress.
