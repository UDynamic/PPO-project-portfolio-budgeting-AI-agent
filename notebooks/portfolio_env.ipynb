    "\n",
    "just like a project with the goal to train an agent to walk, mere walking in a simple direction is not sufficient. we would expect the agent to have the capabilities to walk across uneven surfaces in multiple desired directions and pivot around the obstacles. after that we would strees test the policies and the agent's ability by pushing him or throwing objects at him to test it's ability to maintain the action of walking toward the target destination.\n",

Our choice balances experimental clarity and realism: the latent-factor + shock tests capture first-order correlated behaviors relevant to portfolio budgeting while keeping the study focused."

We model the advance as the first milestone (t=0) with advance fraction α_adv (default 15%). Subsequent milestone fractions are sampled from a Dirichlet distribution and scaled to satisfy Σ payments + retention = BAC. Payments are subject to geometric delays and multiplicative noise. This parametric approach allows the environment to represent advance-funded, milestone-funded, and hybrid contracts with a single, transparent generator; sensitivity analyses over α_adv and retention r are presented to demonstrate robustness.\n",

Additionally, infrequent global shocks (probability $𝑝_{global​}$) synchronously increase delays and reduce payment amounts to simulate systemic stress.
